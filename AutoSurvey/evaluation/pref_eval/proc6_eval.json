{"survey_name": "ChatGPT: A comprehensive review on background, applications, key challenges, bias, ethics, limitations and future scope", "survey_section": "Summary on evaluation of LLM", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been a popular research topic in recent years due to their ability to perform a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks without adaptation on downstream data. ChatGPT, a 175-billion-parameter NLP model, has generated excitement in the NLP community because of its capacity to generate high-quality responses to human input. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate ChatGPT's performance on different tasks, such as answering medical exam questions and solving different NLP problems. Although ChatGPT performs well on several reasoning based tasks, it still faces challenges in solving some specific tasks like sequence tagging. Pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation are the major aspects of LLMs, which have been broadly researched, and the importance of model scaling in LLMs has been discovered. Despite ChatGPT's outstanding performance, researchers have conducted studies on the limitations and categorical archives of ChatGPT's failures in bias, reasoning, math, coding, and factual errors. These studies help in developing enhanced models that better capture language understanding, generation, and performance on different NLP tasks.", "candidate_score": 8.0, "ground_truth_score": 8.5, "explanations": ["9 8\nAssistant 1 provided a very concise and focused summary on the evaluation of LLMs, specifically addressing ChatGPT and its performance, potential challenges, and areas of improvement. The response proved relevant to the topic and included precise details, hence the score of 9. Assistant 2 gave a broader overview of LLMs in general, along with their applications and development, without a strong focus on ChatGPT. While the response contained useful information related to LLMs, it didn't directly address the evaluation of ChatGPT, which is the main focus of the section title. Therefore, Assistant 2 receives a score of 8.", "9 7\nAssistant 1 provides a comprehensive and well-structured summary of the evaluation of LLMs. The author clearly explains the background, applications, advantages, limitations, and ethical concerns of LLMs, as well as their potential improvements and future scope. In contrast, Assistant 2 gives a less detailed response, focusing mainly on ChatGPT. Although Assistant 2 presents some relevant information on ChatGPT's performances and limitations, their response lacks a broader context of LLMs, which is essential for a summary section. Furthermore, Assistant 1 analyzes a comparison of LLMs and discusses those currently in development, providing additional value to the reader. Overall, Assistant 1 delivers a more complete, informative, and relevant section."]}
