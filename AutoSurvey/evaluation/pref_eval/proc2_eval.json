{"survey_name": "ChatGPT: A comprehensive review on background, applications, key challenges, bias, ethics, limitations and future scope", "survey_section": "Summary on evaluation of LLM", "content": "The \"Executive Summary of The Third Report of The National Cholesterol Education Program\" [1] provides updated clinical guidelines for cholesterol testing and management. Meanwhile, \"Adaptive background mixture models for real-time tracking\" [5] presents a common method for real-time segmentation of moving regions in image sequences through \"background subtraction.\" However, to ensure the neutrality of mutations in DNA samples, \"Statistical tests of neutrality of mutations against population growth, hitchhiking and background selection\" [6] present several new statistical tests that examine the detailed pattern of polymorphisms under different scenarios. Lastly, \"Maps of Dust Infrared Emission for Use in Estimation of Reddening and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation Foregrounds\" [3] present a full-sky 100 \u03bcm map that could be utilized as a new estimator of Galactic extinction, useful in estimating millimeter emission, and soft X-ray absorption. These papers provide relevant information that forms the basis for understanding the background and applications of ChatGPT, including key challenges, biases, ethics, limitations, and future scope. However, no specific information regarding the evaluation of LLM was provided.", "candidate_score": 4.5, "ground_truth_score": 9.0, "explanations": ["7 9\nAssistant 1 provided a reasonable response by mentioning different research papers related to the background and applications of ChatGPT. However, the response did not specifically address the evaluation of LLMs, which is the intended focus of the section. Assistant 2, on the other hand, discussed LLMs in detail, covering their background, applications, key challenges, ethical concerns, limitations, and future scope. Assistant 2 demonstrated a clear understanding of the topic and provided relevant information according to the given section title. Therefore, Assistant 2 performed better in providing a comprehensive review on the specified theme.", "9 2\nAssistant 1 provided a comprehensive and detailed section regarding the evaluation of large language models (LLMs), including their development, advantages, appli  cations, limitations, and potential future improvements. The information is relevant to the topic and demonstrates a deep understanding of the subject matter. On the other hand, Assistant 2's section was largely irrelevant to the given section title, as it discussed various unrelated scientific articles without addressing the evaluation of LLMs. The response lacked coherence and clarity in the context of the paper title and failed to provide meaningful information."]}
