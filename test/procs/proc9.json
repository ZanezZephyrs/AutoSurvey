            "content": "Artificial intelligence chatbots have revolutionized various domains, including education and healthcare. Several studies have explored the capacity of these chatbots, such as ChatGPT, and highlighted their applications and limitations. A hybrid literature review by ChatGPT and human experts aimed to summarize the indexed medical literature during the initial four months of ChatGPT's presence. The review found a growing body of literature on ChatGPT's impact on medical education, scientific research, medical writing, ethical considerations, diagnostic decision-making, automation potential, and criticisms. Similarly, a rapid review of literature on ChatGPT's impact on education identified its potential as an assistant for instructors and a virtual tutor for students. Still, there are challenges associated with its use, such as generating incorrect information and bypassing plagiarism detectors. In contrast, a systematic review of ChatGPT's utility in healthcare identifies the potential applications of large language models but highlights the need for proactively addressing valid concerns such as ethical, copyright, transparency, and legal issues. Finally, a systematic review on the use of ChatGPT in healthcare found that specialized NLP models are still a more reliable direction to pursue for critical clinical applications compared to the current release of ChatGPT. Overall, while the potential of artificial intelligence chatbots such as ChatGPT is vast, further research is needed to assess their effectiveness and ethical concerns."
