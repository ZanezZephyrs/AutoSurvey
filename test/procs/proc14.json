        "Summary on evaluation of LLM": {
            "content": "Recent advancements in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have brought about new and innovative applications of Language Models (LMs), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. Several papers have been published that have evaluated the performance and effectiveness of different LM models, including ChatGPT, through various tests. For instance, one paper [1] used ChatGPT to create a literature review on digital twin applications in healthcare. Another study [4] conducted a systematic review of existing publications on the use of ChatGPT in healthcare. It found that currently, ChatGPT has only achieved moderate or \"passing\" performance in various tests and is not reliable for actual clinical deployment. \n\nMoreover, another paper [2] provided an overview of recent advancements in Transformer-based generative models and proposed a comprehensive taxonomy of the main models published recently. This paper discussed how models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 are revolutionizing various sectors and transforming several job positions, such as being a general question and answering system or automatically creating artistic images. However, another study [7] highlighted the issue of LM's robustness and provided a thorough evaluation of ChatGPT's performance from an adversarial and out-of-distribution (OOD) perspective. It showed that while ChatGPT has several advantages in most classification and translation tasks, it is not entirely robust and remains a significant threat to foundation models. \n\nOverall, these papers demonstrate the variety of tests that have been conducted to evaluate and assess the performance and effectiveness of different LMs, including ChatGPT, in various applications and domains. While ChatGPT has shown promising results in several tests, it still has limitations and challenges to face, such as robustness and reliability issues. These findings suggest that research in this area is ongoing, and more comprehensive studies are required to fully understand the potential and limitations of LMs in various applications."
