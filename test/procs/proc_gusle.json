                    "content": "Bag-of-Words (BOW) encodings are a popular approach for representing text\ndocuments in information retrieval systems. In this encoding scheme, each document is represented as a vector of term frequencies, where each dimension\ncorresponds to a unique term in the document collection. BOW encodings have\nbeen widely used in traditional retrieval models, and their application in neural\ninformation retrieval has also gained attention [0].\nThe BOW encoding scheme assumes that the order of terms in a document\ndoes not convey important information for retrieval purposes. Instead, it focuses\non the frequency of occurrence of terms within a document. This approach has\nbeen motivated by the observation that the presence and frequency of certain\nterms can be indicative of the documentâ€™s relevance to a given query [1].\nOne advantage of BOW encodings is their simplicity and efficiency in com putation. The encoding process involves tokenizing the text into individual\nterms, removing stop words, and counting the occurrences of each term. This\nresults in a high-dimensional vector representation of the document, where each\ndimension corresponds to a unique term in the collection. These vectors can\nthen be used for various ranking algorithms, such as cosine similarity or BM25\n[2].\nThe BOW encoding scheme has some limitations. One of the main chal lenges is the sparsity of the resulting vectors, especially when dealing with large\ndocument collections. As the number of unique terms increases, the majority\nof dimensions in the vector will be zero, leading to computational inefficiency\nand potentially affecting the retrieval performance. Various techniques, such as\ndimensionality reduction or term weighting, have been proposed to address this\nissue [3].\nAnother limitation of BOW encodings is their inability to capture the se mantic relationships between terms. Since BOW representations treat each term\nindependently, they do not consider the contextual information or the meaning\nof the terms within the document. This can result in a loss of important infor mation during the retrieval process [4].\nDespite these limitations, BOW encodings have been widely used and have\nshown promising results in information retrieval tasks. They provide a simple\nand efficient representation of text documents, allowing for fast retrieval and\nranking. Moreover, BOW encodings can serve as a baseline for more advanced\nneural models that aim to capture the semantic relationships between terms\nand documents [5].\nIn conclusion, BOW encodings have been a popular choice for representing\ntext documents in information retrieval systems. They offer simplicity and ef ficiency in computation, making them suitable for large-scale retrieval tasks.\nHowever, their limitations in capturing semantic relationships and handling\nsparsity should be taken into consideration when designing retrieval systems.\nFuture research in neural information retrieval can explore ways to enhance\nBOW encodings or combine them with more advanced techniques to improve\nretrieval performance [6,7,8,9].",

                    "content": "Word embeddings have become a popular approach for representing text in \nneural information retrieval systems. Word embeddings are dense vector representations that capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words. \nThese representations have shown promising results in various natural language \nprocessing tasks, including information retrieval and ranking. \nOne common method for generating word embeddings is through the use of \nword2vec models [5]. Word2vec models, such as skip-gram and continuous \nbag-of-words (CBOW), learn word embeddings by predicting the context words \ngiven a target word or vice versa. These models leverage the co-occurrence \nstatistics of words in a large corpus to learn meaningful representations. The \nskip-gram model, for example, learns to predict the surrounding words given a \ntarget word, while the CBOW model predicts the target word given its context. \nThese models have demonstrated the ability to capture linguistic patterns and \nrelationships between words [5]. \nAnother popular approach for generating word embeddings is the GloVe \n(Global Vectors) model [6]. GloVe directly captures the global corpus \nstatistics by training on word-word co-occurrence counts. The model uses a \nweighted least squares approach to learn word vectors that exhibit meaningful \nsubstructure. GloVe has shown state-of-the-art performance on word analogy \ntasks and word similarity tasks [3]. The advantage of GloVe is that it \ncaptures both semantic and syntactic relationships between words, making it \nsuitable for various NLP tasks, including information retrieval and ranking. \nWord embeddings have been evaluated and compared in the context of ranking tasks. For example, in a study comparing different word embedding models, \nit was found that the SWOW-RW and SWOW-PMI models outperformed other \nmodels in predicting guesser responses [4]. Similarly, the associative models, which leverage free association data, were found to emphasize semantic relationships not well-represented within distributional semantic models (DSMs) \ntrained on linguistic corpora [0]. These findings suggest that word embeddings derived from different models can have varying degrees of effectiveness in \ncapturing semantic relationships and predicting relevant information for ranking \ntasks. \nIt is worth noting that the choice of word embedding model depends on \nthe specific requirements of the ranking task. Different models may excel in \ndifferent aspects, such as capturing semantic relationships, syntactic patterns, \nor contextual information. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate and \nselect the appropriate word embedding model based on the specific needs of the \nneural information retrieval system. \nIn conclusion, word embeddings have emerged as a powerful tool for representing text in neural information retrieval systems. Models such as word2vec \nand GloVe have shown promising results in capturing semantic relationships \nand improving ranking performance. However, the choice of word embedding \nmodel should be carefully considered based on the specific requirements of the \nranking task. Further research and evaluation are needed to explore the effectiveness of different word embedding models in various neural information \nretrieval scenarios.",
