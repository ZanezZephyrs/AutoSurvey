        "Summary on evaluation of LLM": {
            "content": "The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been the subject of a few research studies. In Paper 1, ChatGPT performed well in the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE), suggesting the potential for AI to assist with medical education and even clinical decision making. In Paper 2, radiologists assessed the quality of radiology reports simplified by ChatGPT and, while the reports were generally correct and not potentially harmful to patients, there were inconsistencies that need to be addressed in further studies. Paper 3 evaluated ChatGPT's performance on medical questions, achieving accuracies of over 60% on the NBME-Free- Step-1 dataset and showing the model is comparable to a third-year medical student. Additionally, ChatGPT provided reasoning and informational context across the majority of answers, supporting its potential as a medical education tool. Paper 4 explored early adopters' sentiments towards ChatGPT on Twitter, finding predominantly positive feedback, especially regarding disruptions to software development, entertainment, and exercising creativity. However, some concerns were expressed, such as the potential for misuse and impact on educational aspects. These studies demonstrate the potential of LLMs in medical education and knowledge assessment while highlighting the need for further research on their accuracy and limitations."
