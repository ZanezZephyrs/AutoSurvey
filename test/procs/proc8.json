            "content": "ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence-based tool that has gained significant prominence in multiple domains, including healthcare and medical research [1, 3, 4]. In a hybrid literature review conducted by ChatGPT and human authors, it was observed that ChatGPT is being used in scientific research, medical writing, medical education, ethical considerations, diagnostic decision-making, and criticisms [1]. In another review, it was observed that ChatGPT's performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding to unsatisfactory [2]. While ChatGPT has potential benefits such as personalized learning and facilitating collaboration, issues like generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors need immediate attention [2]. A systematic review highlighted that ChatGPT could be promising for health care education, research, and practice; however, there were valid concerns regarding ethics, copyright, transparency, and legal issues [3]. Another systematic review observed that ChatGPT has achieved only moderate or \u201cpassing\u201d performance in several tests and is unreliable for clinical deployment, as it is not designed for clinical applications [4]. These reviews indicate the growing interest in ChatGPT and the need for further research to assess its effectiveness, ethical concerns, and limitations."
