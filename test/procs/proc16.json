        "Summary on evaluation of LLM": {
            "content": "Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have gained considerable attention for their impressive performance across various domains and tasks. For instance, Paper 1 assessed ChatGPT's performance on the USMLE exams, which are essential for medical licensing, and found that it performed at or near passing thresholds without specialized training [1]. Similarly, Paper 7 evaluated ChatGPT on the USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 exams, demonstrating that it achieved a level of performance comparable to a third-year medical student [7]. In Paper 6, ChatGPT was examined for stance detection tasks, with the results suggesting that it can achieve state-of-the-art performance and offer explanations for its predictions [6].\n\nAt the same time, studies have also pointed out some limitations of LLMs. Paper 2 compared ChatGPT-generated scientific abstracts to original abstracts, uncovering that while ChatGPT writes believable abstracts, they are often identifiable using AI output detectors and skeptical human reviewers [2]. In Paper 3, a mixed-method study of ChatGPT early adopters on Twitter revealed that while most expressed positive sentiments, some also expressed concerns\u2014such as the potential for misuse\u2014related to its impact on education [3]. Finally, Paper 4 explored the potential use of ChatGPT in simplifying radiology reports, where it was found that, despite being factually correct and complete, some instances contained incorrect statements or missed critical medical findings [4]. Overall, these findings highlight both the promising potential and existing limitations of LLMs like ChatGPT in various contexts and applications."
